# MerkleTree Implementation using ArrayList
A hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the hash of a data block, and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. 
Hash trees allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures.
A Merkle tree is recursively defined as a binary tree of hash lists where the parent node is the hash of its children, and the leaf nodes are hashes of the original data blocks.
